In this covid'19 pandemic, our team aim was to all help all the doctors to monitor patients so we came up with the idea of all in one mobile app . The mobile app have two different login system, one for normal users and other of the  doctors. This app has 4 key features to tackle this covid'19 pandemic situation.

1) patient monitoring system:  In this part of the app we will get real-time data of patient like oxygen level, heartbeat level, pulse rate which will be taken by the sensor and using IoT all the data will be displayed on the app, it has a feature of alert system i.e. whenever any value of the patient gets below the set mark then the app will generate the alert notification to the doctor's phone.

2) Material Resources: This part is to monitor the count of all the necessary material  like mask, oxygen cylinder, concentrator, face masks  on the app so that staff of hospitals in need can see the availability of resources in the hospital and can take proper action on that.

3) Donate plasma: This is for all user those  are willing to give plasma. They will fill the form in the app and a database will be created. when any patient requires urgent plasma they can find the names and contacts of the people who are willing to provide the plasma.

4) Ambulance Locator: This part is to locate the ambulance to the needy people by just entering their current location. once the location is entered nearest ambulance will be route to this and it will come to help the people.
